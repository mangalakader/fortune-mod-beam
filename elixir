Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency,
distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. Elixir is successfully
used in web development, embedded software, data ingestion, and
multimedia processing, across a wide range of industries.
%
Elixir runs on the Erlang VM giving developers complete access
to Erlang's ecosystem. You can invoke any Erlang function inside
elixir with no runtime cost.

Elixir REPL is called Interactive Elixir and abbreviated as IEx.

Mix is a build tool that ships with Elixir that provides tasks for
creating, compiling, testing your application, managing its
dependencies and much more.

To invoke an erlang function from within elixir, use the following
syntax:

    {colon}{erlang_module_name}{dot}{function_name}(params)

For example,

iex(2)> :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(8)
<<55, 72, 194, 212, 29, 112, 56, 195>>

Here, `:crypto` is the erlang module name and `strong_rand_bytes` is
the function name.

The same function in erlang shell is as follows:

2> crypto:strong_rand_bytes(8).
<<82,108,14,42,155,76,49,52>>

The best thing to do is create a lagom number of processes.
Erlang comes from Sweden, and the word lagom loosely translated means

    "not too few, not too many, just about right."

Some say that this summarizes the Swedish character.

One way I think Erlang was a kind of software emulating Tandem machine.

The inability to isolate software components from each other is
the main reason why many popular programming languages cannot be
used for making robust system software.
